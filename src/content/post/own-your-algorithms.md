Outline
- The problem: Who is Responsible?
  - [Gonzalez vs Google](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/20/technology/supreme-court-tech-section230.html)
  - A family who lost a daughter to a terrorist attack in Paris back in 2015 is suing YouTube/Google for pushing radical content to uses and thus creating terrorists
  - Going after [Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act](https://www.eff.org/issues/cda230), which protects tech companies from lawsuits regarding content their users post.
    - "No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider." (47 U.S.C. ยง 230(c)(1)).
  - The argument is that since YouTube is using an algorithm to suggest content to keep users on the platform, then they should be held responsible for pushing content that instigates violence.
  - :
- What if you were responsible?
  - Instead of a tech company dictating what video you saw next, you did?
  - Self custody algorithms are not necessary a new idea (DO RESEARCH ON THIS)
  - If you owned your own algorithms then you could control what your content feed looks like
- Algorithms as NFTs
  - Web3 offers a good solution for owning, selling or trading algorithms. 
  - Benefits could include:
    - Public on-chain transparency 
    - Trading and selling for artists or influencers
    - Possibility of regulating algorithms
- Conclusion
